                    <p><em>Formula One</em> commonly known as Formula 1 or F1, is the highest class of international
                        racing
                        for
                        open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de
                        l'Automobile
                        (FIA). The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around
                        the
                        world since its inaugural running in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of
                        rules
                        to
                        which all participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races,
                        known
                        as
                        Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents around the world on
                        either
                        purpose-built circuits or closed public roads.</p>
                    <p>A points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for the
                        drivers,
                        and one for the constructors (the teams). Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the
                        highest
                        class
                        of racing licence issued by the FIA, and the races must be held on grade one tracks, the highest
                        grade-rating issued by the FIA for tracks.</p>
                    <p>With the average annual cost of running a team – designing, building, and maintaining cars, pay,
                        transport – being approximately £220,000,000 (or $265,000,000), its financial and political
                        battles
                        are widely reported. The Formula One Group is currently owned by Liberty Media, who acquired it
                        in
                        January 2017 from private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners for £6.4 billion ($8 billion).</p>
                    <p>A Formula One Grand Prix event spans a weekend. It typically begins with two free practice
                        sessions
                        on
                        Friday, and one free practice on Saturday. Additional drivers (commonly known as third drivers)
                        are
                        allowed to run on Fridays, but only two cars may be used per team, requiring a race driver to
                        give
                        up
                        their seat. A qualifying session is held after the last free practice session. This session
                        determines
                        the starting order for the race on Sunday.</p>
